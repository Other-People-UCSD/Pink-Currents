A crab putters in the sand set packed by her steps;<br />
wandering, a trail prints north to<br />
resolution, but little bends depart the arrow.

Follow further and feel the water’s mumble, closer,<br />
move, lures a murmur. Follow this path that joins<br />
the others—wrinkles; waves will soon iron them smooth.

Swallowed by refluent appetites, the footprints<br />
disappear, and briefly, satiate the word<br />
beneath the watchful stormy eye.<br />
Currents scurry thoughts over each,<br />
_pulling_ under the white-crested froth.

The newborn sand beckons passerby;<br />
a temptation—rest the bow, the end is not near—<br />
baited by the body that fishes for dreams.

Behold, the prophet of the deep! Writing<br />
history with hope within its ink;<br />
eroding slowly all eyes can see.
