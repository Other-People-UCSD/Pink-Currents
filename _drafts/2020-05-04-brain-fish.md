There are two schools of

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem; margin-left:25%">fish darting past my stinging eyes, tender in the salty ocean</p>

thought on the topic of

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem; margin-left:25%">fish, I had some nice fried cod the other day.</p>

drowning. Some survivors

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem; margin-left:25%">find shelter in a reef; others are less lucky as the shark circles above.</p>

of this traumatic aquatic

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem; margin-left:25%">fish are the only kind of fish</p>

ordeal have cited their

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem; margin-left:25%">are other fish in the sea!</p>

experiences to be quite

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem; margin-left:25%">fearful of fish is <i>ichthyophobia</i></p>

harrowing, as one would

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem; margin-left:25%">waltz with a wrasse, two-step with a tadpole, cut a rug with a catfish!</p>

imagine drowning to be.

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem; margin-left:25%">He’s swimmin wit da fishes now, see?</p>

However, there are those

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem; margin-left:25%">who escape the net, and others who end up on the sushi table.</p>

who report that for them,

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem; margin-left:25%">fishliness is next to Godliness.</p>

drowning was not painful,

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem; margin-left:25%">in fact, several studies suggest that fish do not experience pain as we do;</p>

but rather peaceful. In

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem; margin-left:25%">fish we trust</p>

fact, one drownee may

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem; margin-left:25%">>゜))))彡</p>

experience both of these

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem; margin-left:25%">kinds of love for fish: fraternal, romantic. In this TED talk, I will outline</p>

sensations, initially going

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem; margin-left:25%">fishing; I’ll be back in a few hours!</p>

into a panic but relaxing

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem; margin-left:25%">their rear dorsal fins, the yellowtail fall into a synchronized dive/</p>

after an acceptance of fate

or a loss of consciousness.
