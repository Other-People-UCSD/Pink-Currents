I"ø<p>So lonely was the old banyan tree that stood between Huntington Preparatory Academy and Valley Public School, that it reached out its wooden arms and asked the world into its embrace.</p>

<p>It yearned for stories, for adventures, for more than the lines on its leaves.</p>

<p>But when the world came, it wasnâ€™t what the tree expected.</p>

<p>Once the world came in the form of a daydreaming flutist, and he made his melancholy music in the afternoon stupor. Heâ€™d scratched his name into the treeâ€™s bark: Violet, like the flowers in his hair, like his nail polish, like his bruises.</p>

<p>The tree wanted to protect his fragile heart. Turns out he could do it himself.</p>

<p>Another time it came as two souls in love: a basketball player with nine fingers and an art history buff with acne scars. They hung origami cranes on the treeâ€™s branches and wished on its falling leaves. He wished for an Ivy League college, vacations in Bali, real friends. She wished for a new prom dress, a signed first edition of Going Solo, immortality.</p>

<p>The tree wanted them to stay together, strong against all odds. Turns out they were doomed from the start.</p>

<p>And so, the cycle repeated, bringing the tree a scrawny fourth grader hiding from bullies, a mourning father with his dead twinsâ€™ shoes, and so much worse. And it hurt the tree, to offer mere respite instead of solutions; it hurt to be so useless.</p>

<p>Little did it know that on lifeâ€™s road of thorns, the respite it offered was gift enough.</p>
