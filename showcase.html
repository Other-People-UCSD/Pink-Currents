        <p><strong>ABOUT US</strong></p>
        <p>Other People Literary Magazine at UC San Diego is the first student-run literary magazine and club. We publish
            biannually in the Fall and Spring, and accept works of fiction, poetry, creative nonfiction, art,
            photography,
            and other artistic mediums. We wish to present the artistic capabilities in UCSD students through an
            inclusive
            platform to distribute creative works, and to encourage literary and artistic expression among all students.
            We
            celebrate our diversity, our individual uniqueness, our shared experiences, and our collective journey
            through
            this world. Check out our issues below!</p>
