            <p>FEM, UCLA's feminist newsmagazine since 1973, is dedicated to the empowerment of all people, the
                recognition of gender diversity, the dismantling of systems of oppression, and the application of
                intersectional feminist ideology for the liberation of all peoples. FEM operates within an
                anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist, anti-racist framework. Our organization seeks to challenge oppression
                based on sexuality, gender, race, class, ability, religion, and other hegemonic power structures. We
                create a wide range of compassionate multimedia content that recenters narratives often rejected or
                ignored within mainstream media. Beyond journalism, FEM engages in actionable praxes by building
                coalitions with other campus and community members. As self-reflective feminists, we are committed to
                unlearning and relearning alongside our global audience as the socio-political landscape in which we are
                situated continues to transform.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The mission of Scientific Slug is to showcase scientific research and science education through
                journalism and creative works. We deeply value diversity, activism, and collaboration throughout the
                science community, by engaging with a diverse number of communities on campus. What sets Scientific Slug
                apart is that we are a student-run science magazine and aim to communicate science in a way that is
                accessible to an audience of scientists and non-scientists alike, in turn fostering an environment where
                scientific and artistic collaboration can flourish. We hope to provide the opportunity for our members
                to learn the technical processes of producing a magazine and to improve journalism skills.</p>
