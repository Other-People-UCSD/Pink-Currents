        alt="Medium: Acrylic on canvas. Within an oval-shaped frame, the top half of a body is painted in shades of red. The figure's eyes are closed and their long hair sticks away from the face, like hair underwater. On top of the body painting are thick white paint strokes: one outlining the shape of the face, multiple coming out of the face outline on top of the hair, two rounded ones over the eyes, two angular strokes going down the chest, and two rows of teeth-like strokes on the neck.">
