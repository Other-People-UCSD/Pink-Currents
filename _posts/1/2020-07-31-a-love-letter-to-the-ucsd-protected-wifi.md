Dear UCSD wifi, you quirky gal,<br>You’re the ultimate femme fatale:<br>Mysterious, fragile, an insurmountable shell-<br>Being cast from your side is unbearable hell. 

You know you’re an affection fiend;<br>You covet my attention, my jealous queen.<br>You’ll connect with me as bright as dawn,<br>But my crush snapchats me- suddenly, you’re gone.

Like an old lover’s lost caress,<br>You’re mine one moment, memories the next.<br>I am a member of your endless empire<br>And your mere touch I do desire 

But, like a long-distance high school romance,<br>You never really had a chance<br>Because last month I got unlimited data<br>LTE is first; you’re now beta.
