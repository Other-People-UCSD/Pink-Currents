thought on the topic of

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem; margin-left:25%">fish, I had some nice fried cod the other day.</p>

drowning. Some survivors

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem; margin-left:25%">find shelter in a reef; others are less lucky as the shark circles above.</p>

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem; margin-left:25%">fishliness is next to Godliness.</p>

drowning was not painful,

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem; margin-left:25%">in fact, several studies suggest that fish do not experience pain as we do;</p>
