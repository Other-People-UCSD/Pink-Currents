![Medium: Photography and Photoshop. A surreal collage mostly consisting of buildings from Havana, Cuba. The images are arranged to mimic that of a street with buildings rising two to four stories tall. Smaller buildings in the back create a second layer of buildings as if they are elevated on a hill.](/uploads/surreal-cuba-geraldine-wambersie.png)
