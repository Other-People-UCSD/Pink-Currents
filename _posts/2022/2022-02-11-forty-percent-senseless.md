    class="w450">

Yoplait, please <br />
don’t play with me. <br />
You call this strawberry? <br />
My tongue turns into a strainer <br />
sampling this paste of pinkness.<br />
All your original sweetness<br />
dripping out from the sieve, <br />
replaced with some <br />
diluted rot disguised <br />
as yogurt. 

This first of many sick meals<br />
will be just like the next &ndash;<br />
nothing savored.<br />
I scoop up half the cup, <br />
trash the rest.

Don’t heed the warning from WebMD:<br />
“You’ll die in four days.”<br />
If spared, I’ll get taste back <br />
gradually, although<br />
my most fashionable self asks<br />
if it ever really left?<br />
I’ve modeled this uniform<br />
for weeks now: pajama pant <br />
bottoms and T-shirt tops,<br />
bed head along <br />
with a sober mien.

/ / / / / 

Smell dissipates <br />
shortly after taste<br />
and I’m left sniffing back <br />
lines of snot. <br />
When my dog trots<br />
snout-first into my room,<br />
I envy the pup, remembering <br />
I too could once <br />
encounter the cosmos <br />
through an inhale.     

Told Mom <br />
my nose feels <br />
like a wind tunnel today <br />
but I knew<br />
this didn’t capture it.<br />
Think “desert”.<br />
Something huge<br />
and empty.    

I keep making mistakes<br />
with my wording,<br />
keep consistent shelter<br />
over the bones<br />
of my bedding. <br />
I wear my blankets<br />
like a nomad’s poncho<br />
when I exit my cave,<br />
bathroom bound.<br />
One test,<br />
lone swab<br />
sealed like sous vide, <br />
lays here upon<br />
the tile shelf, exiled<br />
from the other Q-tips. It waits<br /> 
untouched <br />
in an arid square, keeping <br />
a countdown <br />
until it braves the badlands <br />
yet again.

Listen, spending New Years’ alone <br />
is an under-appreciated concept.<br />
A hopeful slope &mdash;<br />
starting off<br />
at the lowest point,<br />
bedbound by necessity  <br />
when the world resets.<br />
Maybe positive attitudes<br />
nullify positive results?<br />
Maybe cliché is the cure.

But tonight’s the night <br />
to break into your bookstacks<br />
sink into the TV, take solace<br />
in killing time. <br />
Clink your own glass. <br />
<em>Here’s to good health</em> <br />
<em>in 2022!</em> An <em>auld lang</em><br />
sign of things to come.<br />
You’d forget <br />
the fizzy tang<br />
of a toast anyway,<br />
how you hungered <br />
for the age ahead, <br />
champagne bubbles <br />
and fireworks<br />
popping a year's remnants <br />
into zeroes.
