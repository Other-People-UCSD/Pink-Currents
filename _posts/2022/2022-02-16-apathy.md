Thereâ€™s a belief in the air, held within<br />
the subtle inhales of the nameless that<br />
state suffering, the world to Atlas, <br />
the brand on skin, is unequivocally<br />
labeled:<span style="padding-left: 50px">OURS to carry,</span><br />
Nothing to kiss away our shit, no band-aids,<br />
rotten in their packaging, no stickiness <br />
left<br />
to patch wounds or cover things<br />
the face,<span style="padding-left: 45px">the lips,</span><br />
the<span style="padding-left: 30px">shame,</span><br />
This lesson of necessary cognizance over<span style="padding-left: 60px">empathy&mdash;</span><br />
I must understand You, I must be You,<br />
For Me to protect<br />
<span style="padding-left: 150px">You as You are</span>

In any way,<br />
Your body must be a shadow to mine,<br />
refracting images upon my eyes<br />
of the depravity and horrors of life<br />
I will never<span style="padding-left: 140px">understand,</span><br />
because Your suffering, the act of suffering,<br />
does not give You a free pass<br />
for sympathy or a shred of<span style="padding-left: 25px">humanity</span><br />
as humans are not humans if they do<br />
Not<span style="padding-left: 85px">Know</span> <span style="padding-left: 60px">You</span> <span style="padding-left: 75px">Personally.</span>
