Have you ever been to where<br />
the trees went to sleep on St Helen’s?<br />
I heard the birds don’t know which way is which<br />
when the pinetops are laid down like that. 

There is so much sun here, you can store it<br />
in an urn, the way my grandmother stored<br />
rainwater, and bathe in it,<br />
that warm prickly feeling that coats you<br />
like silk. The people here wear shoes meant<br />
for walking, and the paved roads<br />
haven’t lost their ups and downs, not like<br />
the stuff of my city: flattened under concrete dreams,<br />
the heaviness of prayer and coin.

When you drive up, the hours<br />
disappear into the fog and<br />
all the saints have cities in a tongue I<br />
don’t speak, it tastes like sweat and cold nights,<br />
runaway sleep between my teeth. And there’s smoke there too,<br />
in the land between here and red.

The woods are dead in the summer,<br />
or live to die in the fall, so it’s a seasonal thing to fall,<br />
so it’s a seasonal thing to burn,<br />
so if the smoke alarm above my<br />
borrowed bed rings, it’s a seasonal thing for me<br />
to burn, until I am<br />
sand, and then glass, and then something after that,<br />
something to be swept into the dustbin ocean,<br />
where salt is not native on my skin,<br />
and my ashes won’t make it home<br />
to my grandmother’s rainwater urn where<br />
I was raised.
