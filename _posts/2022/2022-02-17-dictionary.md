Quandaries are formed into truth.<br />
(As we can, in this way, call belief the truth.)<br />
Constructed one word at a time, extending each bordered container to define “fact.”

And these elements entrenched and buried within desperation morph into<br />
dense, weighty, diffused hatred&mdash;<br />
a label.
 
Betweens&mdash;Others&mdash;as we know them, are fear-ridden originators.<br />
Societal terrorists, stinging and stinging the eyes of clocks,<br />
a mechanical machine cycle of activators firing one by one, again and again.<br />
The tick<br />
<span style="padding-left: 3rem">Tick</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 5rem">Tickings of comprehension.</span>

The Woman, who is a woman, not a man or an Other, and the Man, who is a man,<br />
not a woman or an Other, and the Other, who is an Other, not a man or a woman.

Reds, Greens, and Yellows disdain for the Purples, Blues, Oranges define why<br />
Rainbows are divided into categories and labeled separate entities fitting strict guidelines;<br />
As variables are violence.
 
A dress, defined by the realities:<br />
<span style="padding-left: 8%">femininity incarnate, decorated and painted;</span><span style="padding-left: 5%">a Christmas ornament.</span><br />
Pants, defined by the realities:<br />
<span style="padding-left: 4%">masculinity incarnate, strong and dominant;</span><span style="padding-left: 5%">abusively bottled explosives.</span><br />
<span style="padding-left: 10%">(but what about shorts? And their commitment to a half and half voice?)</span>
 
The Others search the normative as lexicographers themselves for<br />
<span style="padding-left: 32%">validation, a seen existence.</span><br />
It does not come. In words, in actions. Overridden in the eyes of the<br />
Beholders.
 
The Others disappear.<br />
<span style="padding-left: 24%">But don’t disappear.</span><br />
Hidden in the cracks of absolutes, waiting in motion.
