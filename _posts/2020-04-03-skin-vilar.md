![Water flows from the sink faucet. A one-piece swimsuit hangs on the closed bathroom door.](/uploads/skin-elysia-mac.jpg)

at the hotel room<br>peeling off my bathing suit<br>i catch a glimpse<br>of myself in the mirror<br>and run a finger<br>over the skin<br>untouched by the sun.

in the shower<br>i scrub vigorously<br>at the places<br>the sun had tainted<br>until they all glow red.

i was young,<br>too young to be pretty,<br>but just old enough to know what it was

and just old enough to know that i wasnâ€™t.
