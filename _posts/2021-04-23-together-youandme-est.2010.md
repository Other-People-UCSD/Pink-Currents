The air was still hot.<br>

Summer had not left us<br>

though Autumn had come down<br>

to reign here beside her.<br>

You picked me up--I remember searching<br>

for your car in the parking lot.<br>

That day, things changed.<br>

There were new experiences--<br>

the constant feelings of<br>

today can’t be over yet<br>

and<br>

I’m not ready to leave you<br>

that made me feel like everything leading up to<br>

You<br>

was only practice.<br>

<p style="text-align:right">

Home is a cold room<br>

My numb hand<br>

folded into yours<br>

as we move along<br>

sometimes slowly<br>

Other times twisting and turning<br>

so fast<br>

That you can hear the shink of our blades.<br>

</p>

We still have<br>

those lively argumentsthat you say mirror<br>

The one we had<br>

That dayIn this library--<br>

so many years ago<br>

<p style="text-align:right">

Home is a bed with a cat.<br>

And our limbs<br>

and our wordsand our hearts<br>

Intertwined.<br>

</p>

Time hit us.<br>

With every lashing<br>

we grew together<br>

and apart<br>

and back together again.<br>

You gave me t-shirts, comfort, baked goods, and bad advice.<br>

I gave you books, confusion, a baking set, and mixed messages.<br>

We wanted to be doctors marine biologists lawyers teachers professors writers editors<br>

And now we want to be<br>

Married.<br>

<p style="text-align:right">

Home is with you.<br>

Wherever you areis where I want to be<br>

(unless it’s one of those places that doesn’t exist--<br>

like Wyoming)<br>

</p>

<p style="text-align:center">

One day we will stand there,<br>

Together, YouandMe.<br>

And agree to stay in that place forever.<br>

</p>
