we are lost in the hot sun,<br />
brush and dry dirt<br />
that all looks similar<br />
until you,<br />
perched in an arm of a lake forgotten,<br />
you,<br />
pristine despite the dust,<br />
the algal blooms,<br />
whiter than the snow<br />
youâ€™ll never see,<br />
miles and mountains away&mdash;<br />
you are all poise<br />
as we sweat,<br />
outstretched wings in the shadowless noon<br />
as you take off,<br />
showing us home,<br />
you command our whole attention<br />
without making a sound.
