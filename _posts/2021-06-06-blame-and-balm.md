my baba told me i wasn’t hers<br/>
when she learned i would be a daughter<br/>
i couldn’t carry on the name<br/>
so i could only carry shame<br/>

now my baba lays limp in a floral garden bed<br/>
so i swallow my pride like a fireball<br/>
and reach out for her head<br/>
and call,<br/>
“are you hungry, baba?”

but she spits the rice into my fingers<br/>
the warmth of it running like water, calling me granddaughter, the last of generations of fathers

like a crime, she is ashamed of what she will leave behind

so i threw away her little bottles of tiger balm<br/>
scrubbed away every trace of her aroma<br/>
left her obituaries woven in every psalm<br/>
but i couldn’t wake her from her coma

no, she has woken me from mine

Reflected is a crib and two faces of her mom and sister. Peeking above the makeup table is a ghost of her younger self."
