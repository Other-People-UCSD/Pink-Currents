now that I’m dead, bury me in mangoes
 
none of that grotesque open-casket bullshit<br/>
where they blot cheap eyeshadow over<br/>
festering skin that is already beyond salvaging<br/>
(can’t you feel my corpse<br/>
rolling its eyes from the absurdity?)

and don’t believe the glassy-eyed assemblage of faces<br/>
who ramble nonsense like<br/>
<em>oh, she was such an angel...</em><br/>
<em>oh, she died too young at twenty-one...</em>

I hate cliché decorum, <br/>
but nowhere near as much as I hate that <br/>
in twenty-one years I couldn’t escape from mediocrity<br/>
 <br/>
even my death was probably unspectacular in the end<br/>
(I imagine that I died from choking on<br/>
a mango pit, or something to that effect)

trust me, I am no martyr,<br/>
just another artist who gave up<br/>
before she started,<br/>
another idealist, romantic,<br/>
naturalist wanting to believe in meaning<br/>
carved from quarks and antiquarks

if there is an afterlife, I haven’t found it,<br/>
but I sure hope the mangoes there<br/>
don’t have preposterously large pits<br/>
