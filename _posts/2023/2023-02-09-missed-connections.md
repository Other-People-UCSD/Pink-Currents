    Hey, I’m posting here to ask how I can focus on my classes among all these hot people? I thought I could finally focus on my studies now that it’s exam season, but jokes on me I guess! The only thing I’m studying right now is the pretty smile of the guy in front of me in line at Burger King. If you’re reading this, you in the Twilight hoodie and orange crocs please tell me you waved at me and not someone behind me.

        <span id="1">Hello. </span>
        <span id="2">I’m posting on here today to</span>
        <span id="3">–is “today” too much of a relative term? Am I being too formal?</span>
    </p>
    <p id="2ref">
        <span id="21">Let’s try that again.</span>
    </p>
    <p id="3ref">
        <span id="31">Hiii! Today, I happened to meet</span> 
    </p>
    <p id="4ref">
        <span id="41">Here it goes again with “today.” </span>
        <span id="42">That doesn’t feel right. </span>
        <span id="43">I mean, “today” for me can mean yesterday for you. </span>
        <span id="44">But is there even another word that can replace it? </span>
        <span id="45">“Just now” seems too urgent, and the longer the moments pass the more dated it becomes, even more so than “tomorrow.” “At this time of writing” seems too unfriendly</span>
        <span id="46">, no?</span>
    </p>
    <p id="5ref">
        <span id="51">Maybe the semantics of it are just complicated. </span>
        <span id="52">Maybe my refusal to be satisfied with the word “today” comes from a stubborn emotion deep within my voracious psyche. Because on this page, it will always be “today.” Where its events will be immortalized in a perpetual state of present time. No deadline, </span>
        <span id="53">no lament over the arrival of a “tomorrow.” </span>
        <span id="54">But </span>
        <span id="55">that’s </span>
        <span id="56">not </span>
        <span id="57">realistic, </span>
        <span id="58">is it? </span>
        <span id="59">“Tomorrow’s” only purpose is to spite carpe diem.</span>
    </p>
    <p id="6ref">
        <span id="61">Tomorrow is a reminder that memories degrade like weathering rocks over time just like bonds and stocks you hold over in someone’s heart</span>
        <span id="62">—sometimes the value only degrades, and degrades until there is but new dirt ready to become the soil of another plant in the forest of time. Where the unheard whispers and names caught on tongue only exist as speculative fiction, instead of a sprawled web of desperate words clutching onto a retreating warmth. Where it is entirely laughable to try and figure out the identity of a spirit that slipped through like the sharp breath of a just cracked-open soda through strangers on the internet.</span>
    </p>
    <p id="7ref">
        <span id="71">I try to find the right words as if I hadn’t missed the timing to say them already.</span>
    </p>
    <p id="8ref">
        <span id="81">Let’s say today is a question. </span>
        <span id="82">And I ask, I ask, will you always find me beautiful? </span>
        <span id="83">If so, do you mean beauty like a firework? Like a momentary crescendo that only ends up as cold sparks and ash. </span>
        <span id="84">Like a challenge, I ask about forever knowing that today will always disappear. </span>
        <span id="85">I ask for something simple. </span>
        <span id="86">Simple like a grain of sand, a fiber from a feather, a papercut to find later, the direction of your stare. Something like the warmth of your fingertips, the ends of your smile, the last note of your favorite song. Today is desperate to continue as a question. </span>
        <span id="87">You ask for too much. </span>
        <span id="88">It wants to give you something so small you’d miss it. It wants you to want something so little you’ll start counting down the seconds until your lecture ends, the morning hug of your bed will start feeling tighter, your stomach will becomes a sour craving of the day that you are already in. </span>
        <span id="89">You will want that little thing so much that once given, you’ll forget to want again. </span>
        <span id="90">Or—</span>
    </p>
    <p id="9ref">
        <span id="91">Let’s say today is something that only tries to be—and never becomes. Like maybe no matter how many people I count in a crowd it will never reach anything close to the population of the Earth and the difference between me getting close to them will amount to nothing. Like maybe it will</span>
        <span id="92">, or it does</span>
        <span id="93">, or it has, </span>
        <span id="94">and then the friends, the lovers, the mentors, the people become a simple member of a crowd again, maybe a silhouette, or the vague shape of the number eight billion. Like when a child tries to grow up to be a singer before they try to smile and speak before a crowd other than their parents, they won't become one later. Maybe they study data instead. </span>
        <span id="95">Until someone tells them they love their voice</span>
        <span id="96">—the way they carry their vowels like remainders in simple addition, how their timbre feels as smooth as their morning coffee with a rasp in low tones that matches its bitterness. </span>
        <span id="97">Or—</span>
    </p>
    <p id="10ref">
        <span id="101">Let's say today is that breath on the cusp of spilling out, like words that tremble in anger and that terrible fury that chokes up into tears that try to extinguish the fire you feel. </span>
        <span id="102">But you do not want to be consoled. </span>
        <span id="103">Like a woman’s desperate grasp on the threads of her ripped pantyhose, tubed lipstick now applied by finger, rouge smeared rushed. Today is all hers, but she patches it with clear nail polish and finding someone to kiss so that the lipstick, the threads unraveled, can all be blamed on whose love she exists to receive rather than a sign of her existence in time, of well-worn things, the breeze that once ran through her hair, and being caught </span>
        <span id="104">on a second </span>
        <span id="105">of a minute. </span>
        <span id="106">For today is broken and she intends to mend it. For today is only one out of many before her rapidly approaching expiry date. </span>
        <span id="107">For what is a woman if not defined by her relationship with a man? </span>
        <span id="108">But she does not know that today never breaks, </span>
        <span id="109">it only ever bends slightly at the pressure of her fingertips.</span>
    </p>
    <p id="11ref">
        <span id="111">I guess it doesn’t really matter what connections I have missed or will miss. Ghosts serve no purpose but to haunt, unless kept alive in memory. I keep alive my today by missing it dearly, by shaping it with the press of these keys despite the fact they will not make it out of this draft. But I wonder</span>
    </p>
    <p id="12ref">
        <span id="121">what </span>
        <span id="122">meaning </span>
        <span id="123">will </span>
        <span id="124">you </span>
        <span id="125">give </span>
        <span id="126">today</span>
        <span id="127">?</span>
