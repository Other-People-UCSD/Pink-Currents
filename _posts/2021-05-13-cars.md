You know those idiots  
That stayed in their small towns  
While we all moved away; the ones  
That stayed home and we said  
They’d be going nowhere  

Do you think those idiots are happier  
Than us  
Do you think they’ve found their people, found a group to grow with  
Do you think the bonds we make will really last because  

Lately I’ve been thinking about the years between 30 and 50  
And how lonely they have the ability to be  

I can build a safety net of money  
But I don’t know if I’ll be happy  
I wish I could guarantee myself  
A lover and a child  
To hold when I have nothing left  

Do you think they’d be okay  
Knowing they were my backups  

<hr style="margin-left: 0; max-width: 480px; border-style: solid; background-color: #000">

But lovers leave and children die  
And life’s just a game of uncertainty, I suppose  
If I give each version of myself  
The responsibility of being happy in the now  
Then maybe the nows could add up to forever  

I wish I could create a surplus of happy  
Bottle it up  
And save it for later  
Just like I do with everything else  
But there are no guarantees in this I guess  

No way to know for sure where I’m going  
So why do we live on  
I mean, do we have a choice?  

I suppose death’s always an option  
But it seems silly to reduce  
Every possible timeline that could occur  
To one  
I could do so many things; there’s so many  
Branching possibilities  
It is scary to eliminate any because  
I don’t know which one I’d want  

But I guess ultimately that’s  
The only way to take control  

The only way to know how the story ends is to end it yourself  
But Is that power worth it? Is a car in the midst of a journey  
Expected to crash because you don’t know where it will go  

But back to the idiots  
I think they’re happy  
And I envy what they have  
But I suppose I couldn’t wish it  
On myself.
