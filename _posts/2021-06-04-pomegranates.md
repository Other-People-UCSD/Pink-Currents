To resent the sight of rotten flesh<br/>
decomposing inside my palms.<br/>
Its scarlet seeds dried,<br/>
stale, and scorched from the sun.

A competition lost between me and the birds,<br/>
now lies only a peel,<br/>
the abandoned shell of a fruitâ€™s innards.<br/>
Conceived from a flower,

birthed as a fruit,<br/>
pecked and plucked by the perverse crows

And I<br/>
picking the pieces of the abandoned corpse.
