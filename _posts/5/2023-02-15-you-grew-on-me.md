Only when eyes were elsewhere, your hand held mine,<br/>
lushly conjuring wildflowers up my arm. Lithe roots,<br/>
learning an old dance to a new song, found purchase<br/>
in the fertile soil of a dark heart. We spoke to the petals,<br/>
too bright and feisty to prepare to fall. We told them stories<br/>
of lilacs, of strawberry moons, of a flying snake<br/>
that did not have to eat itself anymore. The flowers<br/>
flushed a jealous shade, twisting a m√∂bius fortune as they told it:<br/>
we would not last the coming winter. The spring, for us,<br/>
could only be new life.
