    class="w450">

it is darker than midnight,<br/>
no lights except the glow <br/>
of human heat, the outline<br/>
of her hands ripping off the mic

off the tour route, she veers to the caverns,<br/>
past the rocks unstable, through the tall<br/>
stalagmites, still and arcing like the <br/>
ribcage inside her racing chest

it is quiet in the cave they do not <br/>
sing over her they do not film her<br/>
they do not take pictures and ask <br/>
her for favors they are not there

alone for the first time in years,<br/>
she takes a breath, it echoes loud<br/>
with no bodies there to muffle it,<br/>
she can hear herself at last.
