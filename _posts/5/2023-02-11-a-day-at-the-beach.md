<div class="beach-reprise">
<div class="day-at-the-beach"><p>a day at the beach &#11167;</p>

<p>scoop through the sands,<br/>
swing your hands up,<br/>
expecting to find shells,<br/>
a dream to hang up.</p>

<p>grains fall through,<br/>
they were never there,<br/>
rough palms remain,<br/>
only wear and tear.</p>

<p>the tide rushes in,<br/>
glazing over your <em>mehnat</em>,<br/>
you think you'll be rewarded?<br/>
<em>mujko hasao mat</em>.</p>

<p>gather up that gold,<br/>
try to build your castle,<br/>
blue seas dance outward, sneering<br/>
as your bow comes unraveled.</p>

<p>lie back, lie back<br/>
to make what's pale not so,<br/>
but on your skin, only roses bloom,<br/>
it was never going to work, you know.</p>

<p>now pack up your umbrella, it's time to go<br/>
as the sun sinks into the sea,<br/>
you tried, right honey?<br/>
at least, it seems that way to me.</p>
</div>

<div><p>but it serves just as well to renew.<br/>
it ain't sunlight, baby,<br/>
the barest light peeks through—<br/>
amidst charcoal shadows</p>

<p>that bathes everything, makes things moonlit,<br/>
it's faith, in a sense,<br/>
the shine speaks to it,<br/>
but, yet, however, even though</p>

<p>hearts and hands are bound.<br/>
now forever still, hold your turmoil, speak never<br/>
that timepiece that was smashed on the ground,<br/>
no ticking, merely its silent sound,</p>

<p><em>mujhe maaf karde</em>.<br/>
they only form tears, anyway.<br/>
<em>kya badi baat hai</em>?<br/>
little bits of silver slivers,</p>

<p>like that's all you needed to reclaim?<br/>
talking about sanity is derogatory—<br/>
like your beloved video games.<br/>
turnabout your thinking,</p>

<p>find forgotten lexapro.<br/>
open your backpack,<br/>
a dewy pearl glows,<br/>
under obsidian nether</p>

<p>reprise &#11165;</p>
</div>
