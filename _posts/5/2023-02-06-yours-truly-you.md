They been lookin’ for a sweet&emsp;&emsp;They can sink into<br/>
They always lookin’ for soft realm They can<br/>
twirl undo caress<br/>
siege<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;one too many<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;often much unwanted<br/>
won’t be tempering what They do<br/>
curse them<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;go ‘head hon<br/>
pierce it<br/>
perform it through wounded view blast your fury up<br/>
blue deep set your heart to match the latest eyelid hue then knock<br/>
dictated reduction off you

walk away<br/>
swear your face be wearin’ final blush bruise<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;better stake self-claim<br/>
shore up every might<br/>
fortify the sides<br/>
queue archers atop<br/>
your renewed lady limits<br/> 
for the citadel will be shaken swarmed a Miss construed<br/>
in your curve shaped formation They<br/>
lurk<br/>
advancin’ to assert<br/>
devalue<br/>
to contort what’s true

so incinerate imposed solitude<br/>
reshape it into fuel<br/>
answerin’ Their question as to who’s runnin’ your rescue

‘til and past death,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Yours Truly You.
