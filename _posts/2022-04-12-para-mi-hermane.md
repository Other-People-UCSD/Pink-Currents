<p><em>I still struggle to embrace the reality</em></p>
<p><em>that my</em> café-con-leche-<em>with-extra</em>-leche-<em>ass self</em></p>
<p><em>has ancestors in</em> México.</p>
<p><em>Somewhere in</em> Nuevo León</p>
<p><em>in the place a third of my last name comes from</em></p>
<p><em>they are there.</em></p>
<p>Mis antepasades.</p>
<p><em>Wanted dead and alive</em></p>
<p><em>by a woman who might never get to meet them.</em></p>
<p><em>Due to fear</em></p>
<p><em>apprehension</em></p>
<p><em>and not knowing who specifically they are</em></p>
<p><em>beyond the hazy memories of a man who chose assimilation.</em></p>
<p><em>Because for all twenty-three years of my life</em></p>
<p><em>I have been taught</em></p>
<p><em>silently</em></p>
<p><em>that anything less than 100% purity negates my authenticity.</em></p>
<p><em>Putting milk in the coffee transmutes it into not-coffee</em></p>
<p><em>faster than the holiest of</em> padres</p>
<p><em>transubstantiates a cracker into sacred flesh.</em></p>
<p><em>I know that I will be branded a</em> gringa <em>for some time.</em></p>
<p><em>Maybe my whole life.</em></p>
<p><em>But I want to change that.</em></p>
<p><em>I want to know more about the language my mother was barred from as a child</em></p>
<p><em>than food orders and pleasantries.</em></p>
<p><em>Because Spanish was the language of “other people”</em></p>
<p><em>I had to learn to be content with hearing it</em></p>
<p><em>as an echo through the cramped halls of an underfunded school instead.</em></p>
<p><em>I want to know more about the music that consecrated the</em> quinceañera <em>I never had</em></p>
<p><em>than an ode to wealthy field workers, set in grainy 2000s cellulose.</em></p>
<p><em>Because watching a</em> Los Tigres Del Norte <em>music video in history class</em></p>
<p><em>doesn’t make up for losing a whole chapter of family scrapbooks.</em></p>
<p><em>I want to know more about who I am</em></p>
<p><em>than the eternally</em> Californian <em>white girl with a spice tolerance.</em></p>
<p><em>Because hell, my nose still runs like a waterfall</em></p>
<p><em>after wolfing down a</em> bolillo con queso y jalapeño.</p>
<p><em>I know that I could have started all of this long ago, </em></p>
<p><em>the day</em> hola <em>first left my lips to mingle with the dusty air of an elementary school trailer.</em></p>
<p><em>That in certain company, every</em> r <em>I fail to roll will earn me the scorn of a dozen</em> mal ojo.</p>
<p><em>But acquiescing to that scorn, to every thought of “just be white” that nips at my brain</em></p>
<p><em>would only be a disservice to the people that have fought and cried and bled</em></p>
<p><em>to bring me into the world.</em></p>
<p><em>So I refuse to stop embracing my history,</em></p>
<p><em>and I refuse to deny reality any longer.</em></p>
<p>¡Soy chicana y no lo negaré más!</p>
