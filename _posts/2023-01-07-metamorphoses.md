The humming of the<br />
cicadas reverberates<br />
against the dry heat of<br />
dusk, drowning out the

tolling of bronzed bells<br />
from a church where I<br />
once prayed for things<br />
I couldnâ€™t understand.

Back then, I would race<br />
through lily-covered fields,<br />
counting the stars after dark,<br />
my tiny hands gripping

onto ash-dusted grass so as<br />
to not drift away into the<br />
heavens. The lilies used to<br />
warn me not to fly away.

Back then, they would clip<br />
our wings as we recited<br />
commandments, lined up<br />
in neat rows like Victorian toy

soldiers whose epitaphs<br />
were already written:<br />
<em>Precious in the sight of the<em/><br />
<em>Lord is the death of his saints.<em/>

But one day I let go<br />
and untethered myself<br />
from the earth and<br />
its gospel symphonies,

fleeing until my stolen wings<br />
melted under the August<br />
heat. As I fell from the<br />
yawning skies, the stars

veiled themselves in the<br />
silken night, and I landed<br />
amongst ivory lilies that now<br />
shrink from my embrace.

The cicadas are weeping for<br />
me, and the church bells<br />
whisper that this is<br />
no longer my faith.
