The morning of June’s nineteenth birthday, she was very aware that he was planning to
end things. She knew this to be true, and just like that, she was right. Self-fulfilling prophecy,
intuitive manifestation, observing what was objectively there: call it whatever you want, she was
right. Whatever unholy bond that existed between June and that <em>boy</em> was unceremoniously torn
apart. Like the breaking of a wish-bone, she took home the bulk of the splintered carcass (make a
wish!). With the decaying remains of something that was supposed to mean more than it was,
June entered her last year as a teenager. Make a wish.

The end of this union was much like the beginning: uncomfortably comfortable in a
situation that was designed, by nature, to be terrible. The first couple dates are always atrocious,
right? June knew this to be true. With her small sample size, she could pick out ludicrous
moments worth sharing over cheap vodka like bingo numbers. There was that scruffy beanie kid
that told June, with a little bit too much pointed enthusiasm, that he just “adores <em>Asian culture</em>”
(completely unprompted, of course). The sweet and shy boy from class that admitted, on the
second date, that he’s had fantasies about saving her from a murderous white supremacist (with,
like, a machete or something). The guy that started crying when she refused to give him head in a
Taco Bell parking lot (she bought him a burrito afterwards to console him). Within this eclectic
range of questionable dating experiences, there was one constant—she’d always somehow find a
way to romanticize the situation, make it just tolerable enough to linger around, let them
embarrass themselves a bit more. A sniffling man-child in her passenger seat nibbling on a
plastic burrito somehow seemed a bit more palatable than being alone. Nibbling the burrito, like
a rat. Rats are cute sometimes. She’d take a rat as company over herself any day. Being alone
was just a little bit too sad.

The summer after high school came and went, a grey drag of half-hearted romance, utter
despair, and becoming a Legal Adult Woman. As if standing on some demented assembly-line
fueled by financial anxiety, June found herself ushered into the world of higher education.
Something small inside of her was dimly aware of the implications of becoming a real College
Girl. It was time for a reinvention; maybe the circus cluster-fuck of her dating history could be
attributed to some kind of underlying characteristic of hers. Maybe she was emanating a sound
frequency only audible to the ears of the most emotionally-stunted of men, maybe she just kind
of hated herself, or maybe it was both. In her free time, she’d agonize over what exactly it was
about her that wasn’t working; she’d systemically run through every feature of hers, every
personality quirk, until she found the potential culprit. The anxious restlessness of her hands, the
unnerving nature of her forced smiles, her lack of childbearing hips—in any case, she resolved to
eradicate whatever it was that was holding her back as she entered college.

Thinking about the endless ways in which she could shape a new life for herself made her
chest swirl. All of the freedom, the opportunities (for a new boyfriend)! Images of cute coffee
shops, cute tote bags, cute boys who don't hate women. June and Him, Him and June—reading a
book together on a campus lawn, over-exposed and blurry pictures, staying up late in his dorm
room. She fixated on these possibilities; maybe the key to reinvention would be a cultured
<em>college</em> boyfriend. No more settling for the backseat of old Toyotas with obnoxiously loud
engines. No, the new one would be different. Cheers to change!

Strategically, June conceptualized the person she would be in college, and she knew
exactly how to manifest her vision into reality: manufactured dreamy look, cool outfits that
weren't cool enough to be intimidating, bold comments about film or music on stand-by. Like
birds signifying their fertility with flashy shows of preened feathers, she hoped to attract the right
kind of dude with her thrifted sweaters and effortless cool. Ultimately, she wanted to emulate the
perfect prototype of a college girlfriend, the flighty and intellectual ones that the protagonist
never truly gets over. If you pulled the string on her back, you’d get something like, “Darren
Aronofsky is just a cheap knockoff of Satoshi Kon!” or maybe “House of Leaves was
poststructuralist dogshit!” Deep enough to indicate that she did in fact possess the ability to read
and think (she’s not like other girls!), shallow enough to not threaten the men who don’t hate
women. Nuance isn’t sexy, ladies.

June settled in nicely with the first boy who was up to her new, more rigorous, standards
(naturally, it was the first one). He was spindly, rather stiff in demeanor, and quite frankly, a bit
of an asshole. His redeeming qualities? He listened to the same bands as her, called himself a
feminist, and was tall-ish. Progress is progress. On their first date, she made a momentous effort
to not say anything stupid, because he definitely wasn’t the type to laugh it off—with his snide
comments and rolling eyes, it was as if he was actively seeking out signs that she was dumber
than him. It became exceedingly difficult to prove him wrong, as she had haphazardly agreed to
sharing a joint.

With her mind racing and body slow, June watched as the dude tossed the glowing roach
out into the field, embers fading dimly in the grass till they faded to black. A dull panic creeped
over the edges of her consciousness. As he rattled on about some dead author, she repressed the
urge to run out and properly throw it away, in case raccoons tried to eat it or something. June’s
mind spiraled as she imagined a mother raccoon, hungry and cold, searching for absolutely
anything to take home to her litter of frail kits. How eagerly she would seize the ashy remains of
the joint, triumphantly returning to her nest (or wherever raccoons live), only to accidentally
poison her children. She’d wail in despair, and collapse to the unforgiving pavement, and it
would be all June’s fault. The end. Fourteen more of these raccoon-laden scenarios later, June
realized it was 4AM and the date was over. The guy was telling her he had a great time, he really
liked her, yeah yeah yeah. By the time June had invested 32 hours into their talking phase, they
were Boyfriend and Girlfriend. How easy it is to not be alone.

<hr>

Nine and a half months later, June is nineteen, alone, and is earnestly trying to pinpoint
why she made for such bad company. She was sure the last guy must have mentioned something
to suggest where she went wrong, but she just couldn’t recall his words very well. In fact, she
couldn’t recall any of the guys over the years very well.

What she did remember was the shedding of her own skin, over and over again; a snake
of a girl, she felt the venom of her heart leaching out into her own blood. The endless characters
and personas that never seemed to stick danced around her head deliriously, taunting her with
their failures, each more lethal than the last. But they weren’t really there—June was alone.
Maybe she was alone all along. Who would choose a snake as company? After all, people have
standards.

Once again, after all of that effort, and all of the men with their nice words, the only
person left was herself. She desperately wished it were absolutely anyone else.

Looking spitefully in the mirror, she concluded it was time for another reinvention.
