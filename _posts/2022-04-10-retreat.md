<div class="poem-img-col"> 
<div>
Riding in<br />
silence<br />
my thoughts<br />
settle on something<br />
sweeter. Silhouettes<br />
of rising pines, fragrant<br />
Phoenician cedars<br />
sensed with<br />
tightened breath<br />
and strained glances.

Reaching the<br />
coastal city<br />
once enriched<br />
by foreign-bound timber<br />
and Tyrian purple.<br />
Its jacaranda-lined<br />
streets and sunlit<br />
stone buildings<br />
offer retreat<br />
from our lives<br />
in Damascus.

<div class="poem-img-col"> 
<div >
Walking along<br />
the shore, we see<br />
soothsayers and<br />
henna hawkers and<br />
a pelican<br />
chained<br />
to a tree stump.<br />
Clipped wings<br />
flap as you<br />
drop coins<br />
in the dish<br />
beside it.

Breathing in<br />
salty air<br />
at a café<br />
on a cliff,<br />
casual<br />
conversation<br />
eludes us.<br />
All<br />
words<br />
spoken<br />
are sharp.

Looking<br />
over<br />
the edge<br />
into<br />
distant waves<br />
you say:<br />
<em>
    Days like this<br />
    end, so let’s<br />
    keep things light.
</em>

<div class="poem-img-col"> 
<div >
Bargaining with locals<br />
for selected souvenirs,<br />
peeling clementines<br />
with fingernails in<br />
narrow alleyways,<br />
juice dripping, us<br />
laughing at the lack of<br />
street names, wandering,<br />
wondering how<br />
we got lost.

Avoiding the topic<br />
of marriage plans<br />
because we’re<br />
<em>keeping things light—</em><br />
and it’s to keep<br />
us going,<br />
as the day’s<br />
sun<br />
loses<br />
intensity. 
 
Arriving at the<br />
ruins of Ugarit,<br />
we read<br />
time-worn descriptions<br />
of age-old inscriptions,<br />
climbing up hills<br />
along crumbling walls<br />
that formerly<br />
formed dwellings.
 
We stop.
 
And I reach for you.
 
But you refuse me
 
since we’re
 
<em>out in the open—</em>

<div class="poem-img-col"> 
<div >
but no one<br />
is around<br />
for kilometers<br />
and still<br />
I can’t get you<br />
to get close to me<br />
despite the trees and waters<br />
and sacred lands laden with<br />
art and artifacts and<br />
temples and tombs and<br />
ghosts<br />
on ships<br />
of sailors<br />
who wrote<br />
letters to lovers<br />
in ancient alphabets.
