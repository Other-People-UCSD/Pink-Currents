He never lived old enough for me<br />
to have my own room, in danger of getting<br />
caught by a cousin who forgot to bring her keys<br />
or the landlord back from the marketâ€”

never had just a room with sunlit sheets,<br />
naked under the covers, a languid display<br />
of taut skin, fingertips hovering, learning<br />
how our bodies worked, his eyes

fleeing borders of life, as if those exact<br />
tentative careful touches before we stretched, <br />
our feet cold that our lips stayed locked,<br />
have remained in the semi-darkness

of this living room, sixteen years after <br />
the fact of his death, always in danger <br />
of being caught in soft tangle of memory<br />
and grief-relief, as clear as his breath 

on my neck, no one coming back, stuck<br />
in the cushions of a sofa I make, believe<br />
is his embrace.
