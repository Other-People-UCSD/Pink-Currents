<p>
    Make it make sense; become the craft. Wrench it<br />
    Up by its roots; shake ‘til meaning spills out.<br />
    Vomit insight on art&mdash;on all, commit.<br />
    Shove opinions down throats; smother their shout.
</p>

<p>
    Frame photographers, shot in our image;<br />
    Deafen singers, tune their voice to our tracks;<br />
    Chisel sculptors into shapes of our casting;<br />
    Spray painters, our colors seal up their cracks.<br />
    Pick the arch up, the architect teeters;<br />
    Stifle directors, here’s plastic vision.<br />
    Write between lines of writers’ fevers,<br />
    Our artist’s eye bleeds tears of derision.
</p>

<p>
    We decomposers make ouroboros;<br />
    we feed off art’s artists feeding off us.
