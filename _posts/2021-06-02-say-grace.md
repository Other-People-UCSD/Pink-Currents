The sky is a purple I’ve only ever seen in dreams<br/>
the wind is calling out to me in coos I might identify as warmth<br/>
and moths have begun to weep at the resignation of my overhead lamp<br/>
the room is filled with ebony albeit hushed and mute

My love<br/>
lies in my grandma's contorted palms<br/>
and the deep tortured roots of all our connected hearts<br/>
our time is tied to this earth<br/>
tied to names and cities we will never own<br/>
our bodies sacred and seething<br/>
we are pressed flowers<br/>
bound to bibles<br/>
and woven into memory

I kept every fan from that summer<br/>
shields against the frothy and dignified Texas heat<br/>
sun shining emerald and melting my chest into the weight of butter<br/>
stained glass figures completed by sky<br/>
church hats peering down at me like halos<br/>
grandma said God is in everything

I can still feel the ridges and grooves<br/>
kneaded into my scalp<br/>
the stiff joints of our dining room table<br/>
my family’s hands coming together<br/>
in bellied laughter and quiet love<br/>
sweet gospel<br/>
say grace
