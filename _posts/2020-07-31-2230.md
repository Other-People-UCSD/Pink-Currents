a draft of wind that touched the sea<br>upon a starless night<br>it was but red, imagined bliss<br>exposed beneath the clouds 

it curled and crawled —slid up my feet<br>at last our sweet reunion.<br>Alas the news have missed our steps,<br>we sway against communion. 

a venom taste, enchanted scent<br>Dear Space, condense our doubts<br>if truth the remedy —our sins, goodbye<br>I dwell —restored at last 

pressed against a tungsten light,<br>the silhouette of sanity.<br>the only memory that remains:<br>dancing — in the ocean.
