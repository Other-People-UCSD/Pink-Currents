Mouth is sewn into a smile,
that constant pulling at my strings.
Pushing a boulder up a quarter mile,
a little doll trying to let out a scream.
Forced to play the puppet in your show
as I let you tear at the stuffing underneath my skin.
How long will this go?
Because this little doll you treat so poorly
has no more string left for you to sew.
