<p style="text-align:right">

Were it by chance when stars had cross’d unseen<br>

Our paths now joined perchance made course a-part<br>

We playwrights, though, set up our present scene<br>

from impulse down and up to pair-link’d heart.<br>

Spoke first time we when shared event had hapt<br>

Had I stayed hour less, or you come in hour late<br>

Had we spoke not of that which keeps us rapt<br>

My appetite may’ve ne’er known your gift to sate.<br>

No tears have I cried since meeting you<br>

and all I’ve the need to give is my laughter<br>

Our moments joint painted peerless hue<br>

Born of friendship’s bosom all thereafter.<br>

T’was our gossamer wings bringing us high<br>

Praise our choices made as our butterfly.<br>

</p>

With you your compass, me my trusty sailboat<br>

A pair from birth, the day we set adrift<br>

But we had a row and now here we take note<br>

the scarlet wings of fear we feel inside ocean's rift.<br>

You are the one who reads for us meant direction<br>

I am the one who listens silent at shared helm<br>

You accuse me, for fault of my failed navigation<br>

As I respond, that instruction is your realm.<br>

But you’d seen east and angry, said west<br>

I had heard west but spiteful, turned east<br>

We know but our choices keep us at rest<br>

and we face not treasure but tragic beast.<br>

If only we could blame this on a fate worst<br>

But ‘twas our butterfly that left us curs’d.<br>
