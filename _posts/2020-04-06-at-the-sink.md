![Through a window of the rainforest, a macaw flies into the kitchen. Someone washes a dish in the sink.](/uploads/sink-imanol-tovar.jpg)

My mother stands there at the sink, washing the dishes<br>That were used just minutes before.<br>And her hands go washing, washing,<br>As she stares at her reflection in the window.

She’s running towards a jungle,<br>While the sun licks at her mocha skin.<br>And they cry _‘Morena! Morena!’_<br>As she laughs and tries to catch at birds the color of the rainbow.

She’s moving from a homeland,<br>A strange language on her lips.<br>And her dreams are larger than the moon and the earth,<br>More infinitely grand than the stars.

She’s walking down a street,<br>In the place where futures are made<br>And her passion runs hotter than the blood in her veins,<br>Yearning for a chance to be great.

But

My mother stands now at the sink, washing the dishes,<br>That I used just minutes before.<br>And her hands go washing, washing,<br>As she stares at her reflection in the window

And sees all those dreams fly away,<br>Just like jungle birds<br>The color of the rainbow.
