    SETH:<br />
    (<em>to investors</em>) Welcome, welcome one and all / Have I got a product that’ll answer the call / Ever wished your phone was the size of a child / Well I’ve got something that’ll make you go wild / Ever dreamed of a computer the size of a pea / Well I’ve got something that you’ll want to see.
</p>

<p class="right-50-block monospace"><em>Investors clap, enamoured by Seth’s ‘performance’. Spotlight shines on Seth, and the investors fade away. Seth turns to face the audience.</em></p>

<p class="monospace">
    SETH cont.:<br />
    You’re wondering how I procured this condition? / Apparently it was my unchecked ambition / A young bright-eyed lad, I surveyed the land / In search of a fad to add to my plan / And found the lucrative tech industry / Progressing with unmatched rapidity / And as my success grew / So my enemies did too / (<em>whispers</em>) An old hag with a jealous streak / Came to me one night that week / And begged me for–

    So naturally, I said ‘Ew. Like I care’ / All at once she transformed

    SETH:<br />
    You there sir, what is your query / Have you come to test my solid theory?
</p>

<p class="monospace">
    INVESTOR 1:<br />
    Um...no. I just wanted to know how much you needed for this product?
</p>

<p class="monospace">
    SETH:<br />
    AH! Good question, you shrewd man / 20 million will aid my plan!
</p>

<p class="monospace">
    INVESTOR 2:<br />
    20 million dollars for a seed round?! That seems a bit steep for a...what was it?

<p class="monospace">
    INVESTOR 2:<br />
    Well, I’ve got to say, I’m really enjoying your whole pitch, but I’m not completely sure there’s product market fit. What’s your target demographic?
</p>

<p class="monospace">
    INVESTOR 1:<br />
    Yeah, how much do consumers actually want a tiny computer and a really big phone?
</p>

<p class="monospace">
    SETH:<br />
    (<em>restrains himself from calling INVESTOR 1 a cream-faced loon or a foul stewed prune</em>) You see my friends, THEY want it bigger and better / I’m not marketing to the common beggar. (<em>SETH says ‘better’ in a way that rhymes with ‘beggar’</em>)

    I promise, sir, that you’ll win too / This won’t be Napoleon’s Waterloo / My wares will make you filthy rich / And so concludes my fateful pitch

    INVESTOR 1:<br />
    (<em>Looks at Investor 2 and nods</em>) Ok, I think we’ve heard enough. We’re really impressed with your pitch. We’re gonna speed through the due diligence process and close out your round right now. The 20 million dollars is yours! Welcome to the Sequoia Capital Family!

    ‘Tis a success! / But I digress / That concludes my humble quest / Now I have thwarted that spiteful witch / Karma's fun but payback’s a bitch / The crone did warn against my greed / But to her caution I did not heed / Though her curse dug me a rabbit hole / It led to venture capital / My rhymes were made for industry / Filled those investors with much glee / She said she hated my egotism / But thank the gods for capitalism!
