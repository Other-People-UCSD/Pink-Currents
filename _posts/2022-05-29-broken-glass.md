Thirty-five degrees under the still-falling snow,<br />
I’d stand outside the door, half hoping you’d show

up in front of me and I’d have to confess<br />
I’d been waiting for you as a saint doing penance &mdash;<br />
a threadbare coat in the cold just to beg for your blessing.

I kept delusional vigils, then walked home alone,<br />
knelt in the footsteps you left on the road;<br />
you don’t want a saint and I don’t want a ghost.

Now I shatter your altar, make shards of the past,<br />
walk over you like I’m on broken glass,<br />
strike at myself and imagine your hand.
