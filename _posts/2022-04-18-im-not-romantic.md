“I’m not sentimental&mdash;I’m as romantic as you are. The idea, you know, is that the sentimental person thinks things will last&mdash;the romantic person has a desperate confidence that they won’t.”<br />
&mdash; F. Scott Fitzgerald, <em>This Side of Paradise</em>
</p>

I'm not romantic<br />
The borrowed kisses, familiar touches<br />
Sweet words before sleep&mdash;<br />
The goodbye to an empty bed&mdash;<br />
Become a faint nostalgia<br />
A whisper I’ll always never want to hear 

Forced laughter, old trophies<br />
Late nights in the passenger seat<br />
After home games, after store runs<br />
Cheap answers from school days,<br />
Nine to five weariness that tightens our every breath.

When did we get comfortable clutching the heirloom jewelry<br />
That stretches between us,<br />
Waiting for the wrong sigh<br />
To snap what is always restrung?

I look away for one second and the thin strand pulls apart,<br />
Bringing the fight we were no strangers to.<br />
I watch the sharpied glass on the windows through my self<br />
Broken over, repaired<br />
With cheap apathy and apology to apology to apology<br />
That tried but never truly satisfied us.<br />
The cycle of jitters overcomes us at every wrong word

When your fire comes and throwing sand doesn’t work<br />
I must walk into it<br />
So the flames don’t lash on another face&mdash;<br />
Embrace another pile of flesh.<br />
A fire that I once knew as warm, nurturing in its light<br />
Has somehow stripped away every sliver of my skin

I know that your promises to change<br />
Will be realized when Sisyphus finally makes it to the top.<br />
You’ll tinder underneath the brush,<br />
Letting the wind take advantage of your docility<br />
Until I breathe into a spot of flame,<br />
Recreate the suffocation&mdash;<br />
A fire to remake me as you’ve said<br />
To burn off the dead skin, to reveal the fresh pink<br />
It’s what’s best for me what’s best for me<br />
What is best for me?

I bear every echo and unwanted memory<br />
Carrying a box filled with school notebooks,<br />
Old pictures, chewed gum<br />
As you ask me how my day was<br />
Or look at me as I am a silver glass to you<br />
And for a second your pride destroys<br />
Every notion that our love is normal<br />
And will forever bury itself deep into my skin<br />
Your skin
