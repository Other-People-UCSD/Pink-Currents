The Academy awards 2020 featured a historic win for South Korea as Bong Joon-Ho’s 2019 film “Parasite” became the first ever foreign language winner of Best Picture, alongside the awards for Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best International Film. “Parasite” will hopefully open the door for more non-English speaking films to become further recognized in mainstream media. Although the film was a direct portrayal of the socio-economic issues present within South Korean society, the disparity of wealth within capitalistic systems is applicable to any other country whose economy relies on private enterprise. Films like “Parasite” force us to look past cultural dissemblance, and allow us the opportunity to identify ourselves in those whom we least expect. Despite the long-held propensity for Americans to reject foreign cinema on the basis of the language difference, in the words of Bong Joon-ho: “Once you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.”
