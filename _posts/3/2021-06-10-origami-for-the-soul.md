Origami for me is a form of creativity that works really well with modern life. It is a way for me to channel my energy and step away from the computer screen after a long day. Giving origami models to others is also a way for me to express gratitude to those who have provided me a lot of friendship and support during the last year. Origami is unique, I think, in the sense that it can be done by anyone, anywhere, with a piece of paper. The origami community is also distinctive for its fellowship — designers freely share designs and instructions, you can find an abundance of online folding sessions where you can meet people from around the world, and there is no such thing as a ‘wrong turn’ when you are folding paper.
