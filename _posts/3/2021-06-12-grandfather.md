    <p style="margin-left: 200px; width: fit-content">grandfather</p>
    <p>whisper thank you,<br/>
    bitten words<br/>
    mumbled<br/>
    trembling at the sound of<br/>
    shame<br/>
    when you know you<br/>
    mean to say more<br/>
    you wish you knew<br/>
    how to say more<br/>
    reaching out for the tones<br/>
    of a language that is supposed to be yours<br/>
    how do you even begin as he<br/>
    traces history<br/>
    on his left hand and<br/>
    hands you the remote<br/>
    with his right<br/>
    green veins splayed on skin<br/>
    like rushing tunnels<br/>
    of buried memories</p>
    <p>the stories<br/>
    dissipate into the blue<br/>
    screen</p>
    <p>what language<br/>
    does silence speak<br/>
    but anticipation and<br/>
    closed eyes</p>
