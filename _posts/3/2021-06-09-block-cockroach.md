You feel that? Fuck yeah, black mold. You get closer—why? You haven’t put your glasses on
and everything is blurry. Three years ago, you learned dorm rooms looked better that way. If you
were a masochist, you’d take a blacklight, absolutely. If you wanted to make a night of it, you’d
make a shroom tea first. Or one of those mugwort teas you keep seeing on TikTok. I could see a
psychedelic sludge being more pleasant. Maybe it would appear to you as little friends greeting you
from the cute little darkened corners of your cute little residential cubicle. Hiiii.

Heyyy... what’s that? You’re doing yoga because you promised yourself you would try to be
flexible this year. You’re on the ground, face up. You glance to the right, and what do you see? A
cockroach. Obviously not a registered student, and frankly really disrespectful when there’s a no-guest
policy in effect here at the university. Literally so incredibly rude. It’s the largest insect
you’ve ever seen in your life, and you lie completely still as you watch it scuttle about with its
spiny disgusting legs. Back it up right now!! Too, too close. You have to bust out the household
cleaner. You have to. It gives you the ideal bug-to-self ratio, though you must mind the furniture.

Oh god, where did it go? It left while you were internal monologuing.

Knock-Knock? They’re drilling through your sexy bathroom floor. You curse the sulfurous
ceiling of the room below you and sigh as a maintenance worker tapes off your toilet in lovely
orange. You were fully prepared to seize the day, but now the whole day is shot, and all is
completely lost. You take calls with sawing in the background and contemplate the consequences
of screaming. You apologize for the mess. You weren’t expecting anyone to see your ADHD
goblin lifestyle. Now they’ve seen. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to clean a bit. You glance at the
mango you’ve left on the shelf, the roasted potatoes on the desk, the coffee cups in military
formation, your collection of bed pens and bullet journals. At least you’ve kept your plants alive.

If you don’t look at them, they aren’t dead.

Cuh-motherfucking-caw? A group of crows, or ravens, or whatever—you never took the time to
learn San Diego birds—dances on the tree outside of your third-story window. They crank out
what you honestly imagine to be a really homophobic bird song from about 5 A.M. to about 5
P.M. Their beady little goddamn eyes mock you every day of the week as you attend calls. They
know exactly what they’re doing and they simply don’t give a shit. When they grow tired of the
tree’s texture on their stupid bird feet, they head on over to the roof and perform a little tap
routine just for you, just for your own personal enjoyment. Isn’t that so nice? You love it.

Uhhh, excuse me? The night’s storm has apparently brought you globs of water to fall through
your window and startle your 3 A.M. self, right in the face. You stare your rainwater eyes at the
popcorn ceiling, waiting to graduate. If the rain falls once or twice more in the same spots, it will
most definitely poke itself all the way through, and it will most definitely not be a good morning.
Your university housing wakes up daily and chooses absolute violence. You stretch your arms
out and slap your knuckles into the thinly painted walls. Ugh. You look up. A bright red fire
alarm glares at you with a condescension worthy of a queen. Fear of that fire alarm keeps you
from lighting candles and that’s why the energy is so, so off in here. You get up and attempt
compensation with three essential oil diffusers. The solution to internal conflict is to make a
cloud for yourself to sulk in. One that smells like eucalyptus and thickens the air to taste like
droplets. Petrichor pills for the slumber send-off, over the eyes, and in the nose. Sleep.
