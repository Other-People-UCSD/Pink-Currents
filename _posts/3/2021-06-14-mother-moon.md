My piece titled ‘mother moon’ holds a lot of sentimental value to me and is dedicated to my biological mother who
I have never met, as I am a transnational Chinese adoptee. My inspiration for the ‘mother moon’ stemmed from my
childhood belief that my biological mother sent the moon to watch over me every night to protect me. To this day I
find comfort in knowing the moon will return every night to remind me I am not alone.
