<div class="little-doll-main white" title="A blonde-haired doll with a scribbled pink blouse lies on the floor. Her purple smile is finished being sewn.">
<strong><em>Little Doll</em></strong><br/>
My mouth sewn into a smile,<br/>
that constant pulling at my strings.<br/>
Pushing the boulder up a quarter mile,<br/>
a little doll trying to scream.<br/>
Forced to play the puppet in your show<br/>
you tear the stuffing underneath my skin.<br/>
How long will this go?<br/>
Because this doll you treat so poorly<br/>
has no more string left for you to sew.<br/>
</div>
